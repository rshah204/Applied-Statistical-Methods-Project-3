Applied Statistical Methods: Regression Analysis of Bordeaux Vintage Wine Dataset
----------------

• Constructed a regression model that predicts the price of the vintage as a function of its age, rainfall, previous rainfall, and temperature. 

• Interpreted the data through appropriate scatter plots (such as plots of price against the various explanatory variables), summary statistics, and the output from the regression analysis. 

• Checked the adequacy of the model by looking at residual plots.
